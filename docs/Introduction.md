# Introduction:

Soli-LMS is a powerful and flexible Learning Management System designed to support training organizations and educational institutions.

Soli-LMS makes it easy to manage all parts of the training process, from setting up projects to assessing learners' progress.

Trainers can create and organize training projects, set clear objectives, plan educational activities, and provide learners with the resources they need. Learners, in turn, get personalized tracking of their progress, can view their grades and feedback, and easily access learning materials.

Soli-LMS also helps manage human resources, training modules, skills development, and self-training paths, offering a complete and efficient solution for training management.
