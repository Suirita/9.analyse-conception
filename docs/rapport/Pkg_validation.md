# Pkg-validation:

In our project, my main focus is on the validation package. This package is important for making sure training projects meet quality standards and that learners are evaluated fairly and constructively.

By validating each skill tied to these projects, trainers can assess learners' work using the validation package.

This feature helps ensure that projects align with training goals while improving learners' skills through clear and personalized feedback.
