### Problem Definition for the **pkg_validation** Feature

The issue with the **pkg_validation** feature lies in the need to provide a centralized and intuitive system for assigning skill levels and adding comments, in order to meet the specific needs of each stakeholder in the **Soli-LMS** system (training manager, trainer, learner). Currently, the available tools lack clarity and consistency, making it difficult and demotivating for users to track skills and progress.

---

1. **For the Training Manager:** They need a clear, granular view of skill progression by levels, as well as standardized tracking of feedback to ensure consistency in evaluations. However, the lack of a structured tool complicates the organization and centralized visualization of skills and comments.

2. **For the Trainer:** They lack a flexible tool that allows them to intuitively rate skills and add constructive comments for each learner. The absence of centralization and feedback tracking limits their ability to personalize evaluations and communicate effectively with learners.

3. **For the Learner:** They need a simple and accessible view of their skill levels and comments to understand their learning journey and areas for improvement. The current tools are confusing and do not facilitate understanding of progress, which diminishes motivation and engagement in learning.

In summary, the problem to solve with **pkg_validation** is to design a centralized, consistent, and intuitive evaluation system that allows for tracking skills and adding personalized feedback, while addressing the needs of each stakeholder in the **Soli-LMS** system.
